For now please add open datasets as issues untill we determine how and were we will store this information.

We need help with documenting what is available. 
Currently we are using the Wiki in the repository but soon we will need something more like a formal data dictionary, 
but easily searchable. 
Please submit an issue if you know software that would meet this need or have an idea for a design.

# kc-open-data-library

The goals for this project are to foster multi-brigade collaboration, ease onboarding for new members, increase supply of civic ideas, reduce project redundancy, provide CfA projects reach overview. 

See ![Project Hub](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/kc-open-data-library/blob/master/doc/images/Code%20for%20America%20-%20Projects%20Hub.%20By%20city.%20Filtered.png)

The plan is to put the Hub on CodeforKC website first, and then propagate it to the other sites for the betterment of CfA and society at large. 

A cry for help: "Help!!!"

For this project we'll need: 

* suggestions, enhancements,
* concise taxonomy of civic categories (I have made the first stub at it, but most probably missed some), 
* the progress substeps for 'Code' step (I am more comfortable with project definition), 
* map geolocation filter,
* JavaScript, 
* form-processing,
* backend coding,
* ???

We want to finish the visual design and write HTML/CSS for the project cards and for main hub layout.
Notice that this design is mobile adaptive. If you would like to make a mobile layout, it would be fantastic.
